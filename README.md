# Cyber-Physical-Systems-Consensus-and-SVFB
## Authors Daniele Bigagli, Federico Maresca, Salvatore Sipione
Codebase for two projects, one on the Consensus Algorithm in multi agent systems and another on State Variable Feedback control in multiagent systems.
## Consensus
The consensus problem simulates a multi-agent CPS for a localization and tracking algorithm (IST,DIST, ODIST) and uses some cost functions such as success/failure rates and distance from target as results to compare the methods.

## SVFB 
The State-Variable Feedback Control project uses either a Local observer and a Neighbourhood Observer together with a SVFB regulator to achieve control in a cooperative tracking problem where a leader agent instructs follower agents through state variable manipulation.
