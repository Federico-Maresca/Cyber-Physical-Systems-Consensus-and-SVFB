## Authors Daniele Bigagli, Federico Maresca, Salvatore Sipione
Codebase for two projects, one on the Consensus Algorithm in multi agent systems and another on State Variable Feedback control in multiagent systems.
## Consensus [Paper](https://github.com/Federico-Maresca/Cyber-Physical-Systems-Consensus-and-SVFB/blob/main/Consensus/Consensus%20based%20Localization%20and%20Tracking%20in%20a%20multi-agent%20system.pdf)
The consensus problem simulates a multi-agent CPS for a localization and tracking algorithm (IST,DIST, ODIST) and uses some cost functions such as success/failure rates and distance from target as results to compare the methods. Related paper.

## SVFB [Paper](https://github.com/Federico-Maresca/Cyber-Physical-Systems-Consensus-and-SVFB/blob/main/SVFB/On%20SVFB%20with%20Local%20and%20Neighbourhood%20Observers.pdf)
The State-Variable Feedback Control project uses either a Local observer and a Neighbourhood Observer together with a SVFB regulator to achieve control in a cooperative tracking problem where a leader agent instructs follower agents through state variable manipulation.
